🗺️ Exploration & World Building
    Custom RPG Quests: Over 20 new quests, including the King of Rats story (5 seasons with unique rewards), Desert Quests (12 mysteriandos each) and a secret retro outfits quest.
    New Content & Hunting Grounds: Unused monsters have been converted into custom creatures. New continents and hunting places have been added to the existing map.
    Chest Systems: One-time reward chests and regenerating loot chests are scattered across the world.
    Simplified Access: The Warzone access quest is simplified (can be skipped via NPC), and Gnome items are purchasable with Major Tokens.
    Atmospheric Details: Immersive touches like cows that fart and Old Man Frost, who charges 50 gold to view his mammoth.

⚔️ Combat & Gameplay Mechanics
    New Utamo Vita: A revised mechanic where only a portion of mana protects health. Cooldown is reduced to 2 seconds with 0 mana cost. Sorcerers and Druids cannot wear Energy Rings.
    Self-Sio: Druids can now use the Exura Sio spell on themselves.
    Item Reworks: Rare and unused items have been updated with new positive and negative attributes. Thrown weapons like Assassin Stars have a reduced break chance.
    Cledwyn's Equipment: Reworked offers featuring cheaper items that grant higher skills but significantly reduce certain resistances.
    Training Systems: Offline training rooms are available in most towns, featuring underground training statues for active training (with reduced attack speed).
    Extended Throw Range: Items can be thrown 1 tile further than standard servers (9 horizontal and 7 vertical tiles). 

👾 Monsters & Loot System
    Longevity Bonus: Killing a monster that has been alive for a long time (at least 40 minutes) grants an experience bonus, with longer living monsters grating more experience (up to a certain cap).
    Fiendish & Boosted Monsters: Five random boosted monsters are selected daily. Fiendish monsters now have suffixed names indicating their strength level.
    Rare Minibosses: Killing certain monsters has a small chance to spawn a corresponding rare miniboss.
    Layered Loot Messages: Loot messages are split into "base", "boosted", "prey" layers etc. for better clarity.
    Loot Trimming: "Lootbox" items (e.g., Gnomish Supply Packages) have had most junk removed, leaving only valuable items.
    Skinning Update: The skinning system has been expanded to include a much wider variety of monsters.
    Raids: Global monster raids occur throughout the day, with powerful raids announced via server-wide messages.

📈 Progression & Character Growth
    Wheel of Destiny: Each level grants 3 points instead of 1. Wheel Scrolls have infinite uses and can be found in hidden chests.
    Prey System: Cheaper rerolls, wildcards available in magic shops, and higher maximum bonuses. Includes a "pity system" for star increases and level-appropriate monster rolls. Prey time only ticks down when fighting the selected target. Rerolling monster or exhausting prey time will reduce your stars.
    Exaltation Forge: Simplified progression requiring only a Tier 0 donor item (e.g., T5 + T0 = T6).
    Charms & Bestiary: Reduced kill requirements for all difficulties. Monsters that are sparse on the map require even fewer kills.
    Task System: Daily task boards in cities. You can accept tasks even after exceeding the max level if you haven't completed them yet. Bosses can be challenged immediately after finishing the kill count.
    Daily Rewards: Claiming a reward instantly grants a 7-day streak and all associated bonuses. 
    
🏪 NPCs & Services

    The Great Tracker: This NPC is available in every major city, offering imbuement items in exchange for gold and task points.

🛠️ Technical & Quality of Life

    Permanent Key System: Use door keys on the "keys in satchel" (in store inbox) to permanently unlock access to those doors.
    Container Logic: Equipping items via hotkey from a full container will no longer fail if there is space in any parent container.
