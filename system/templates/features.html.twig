1) We implemented over 20 custom rpg quests. Amongst them: King of Rats HQ (teleport hub), King of rats story (5 seasons; exercise weapon rewards, new hunting places), Desert Quests (12 mysteriandos in each quest), Enter the Drunk Tank (unlock using better mana/health potions), Prodigal son (help chester investigate prospect workplace and discover new hunting places), a very secret retro outfits quest.<br><br>

2) Server save occurs around every few seconds. In case of rollbacks, this greatly recudes its magnitude.<br><br>

3) Prey grid rerolls are cheaper and wildcards can be bought in magic shops. Maximum prey bonuses values are higher than usual. Rerolling prey bonus type doesn't guarantee an increase to stars, instead you have a chance to either increase or decrease the stars. Each failed reroll while at a certain star level will increase success chance while at that start until successful increase. When rerolling a grid with random monsters, only monsters that are at least 20 on the map can be rolled. Also, when rerolling a grid, only monsters that are suitable for your level are rolled. Prey time decreases only when killing a selected monster.<br><br>

4) Wheel scrolls can be used infinitely. They can be found in one-time chests hidden throughout the whole map. Each level grants 3 wheel of destiny points instead of the usual 1 point.<br><br>

5) Claiming a daily reward instantly sets your streak to 7 days and grants all bonuses.<br><br>

6) Store inbox items don’t reduce your capacity. They cannot be traded with players, sold to npc, listed on market, etc. Wheel scrolls, door keys, exercise weapons and most quest items go to the store inbox.<br><br>

7) Door keys can be used on keys in your satchel (check your store inbox) to be permanently unlocked. Keys in satchel can be used on any door for which you have unlocked the corresponding key.<br><br>

8) Exaltation forge requires the donor item to be tier 0. Eg. tier5+tier0=>tier6 <br><br>

9) Each day, 5 random boosted monsters are selected.<br><br>

10) One-time reward chests and chests with random loot that regenerate were added to the existing continent and the new continents.<br><br>

11) Killing a monster that was alive for prolonged time will grant increased experience. If a monster lives at least 40 minutes, it will grant a bonus exp. This bonus caps out at 250% of base value.<br><br>

12) Utamo vita uses a new mechanic, where only part of your mana is used to protect your health. Additionally, utamo vita cooldown was reduced to 2 seconds, and the cost to 0 mana. Sorcerers and druids cannot wear an energy ring.<br><br>

13) NPC names, dialogs, quest names, mission names, mission descriptions and some item descriptions are being translated. Currently we are using Polish and English language.You can change your language with !language, !lang, !en or !pl.<br><br>

14) Killing a monster shows a loot message that is split by loot layers. Example: Loot of a goblin assassin: a short sword, 7 gold coins, a fish (base) a small axe, a short sword, a gold coin, a leather helmet (boosted loot).<br><br>

15) Exura sio can be used on the druid caster themselves.<br><br>

16) Items can be thrown 1 tile further than on other ot-servers - now it is 9 horizontal and 7 vertical tiles.<br><br>

17) 4 new travel NPCs were added: pirate ships, flying carpet, camel ride and a metro. Existing travel npcs had their routes extended to new places. The first 10 trips are free.<br><br>

18) Travel NPCs react to travel keywords (sail/fly/ride, etc.) even if you haven't greeted them yet. Travel npcs will open the destinations window when you left-click them. Respectively, NPCs that have shops will show their offer when left-clicked.<br><br>

19) Exceeding task maximum level while never completing that task will allow you to accept it and complete it one time. Tasks bosses can be challenged right after killing required monsters - you dont have to visit npc beforehand. <br><br>

20) Old quests have their exp rewards and item rewards massively reduced.<br><br>

21) Some of the unused monsters were converted to custom monsters and can be killed in new hunting places.<br><br>

22) Old man frost will charge you 50 gold coins for looking at his mammoth.<br><br>

23) Cows fart.<br><br>

24) Banker NPCs will react to ‘withdraw all'.<br><br>

25) Fiendish monsters also have a suffix in their name, indicating their strength.<br><br>

26) Tasks selection window is sorted alphabetically.<br><br>

27) You can reorganize the store inbox' items order.<br><br>

28) Equipping an item A, which is in a full container, with hotkey while you already have an item B in that slot (eg. ring slot) will not fail if you have free slots in any of A's parent containers. <br><br>

29) You can use the daily task board in most cities to accept daily tasks. After completing daily task, it can be turned at any town ruler (if it has one).<br><br>

30) Charm points require less monster kills at all monster difficulties. Monsters that are sparse on the map will require even less kills to grant charm points.<br><br>

31) After killing certain monsters there is a small chance to spawn a corresponding rare miniboss.<br><br>

32) The warzone access quest is simplified and can be skipped by talking to the first NPC. Gnome items can be bought with major tokens.<br><br>

33) Some of the lootbox-like items (e.g. gnomish supply package, mysterious remains) have had their loot trimmed, so only valuable items remain.<br><br>

34) Skinning was updated, allowing you to skin many more monsters.<br><br>

35) Most towns now have offline training rooms. Each room has underground stairs leading to training statues which can be attacked. While in the training room, your attack speed is greatly reduced. <br><br>

36) Every few hours, you can fight bosses such as werecreatures and Kroazur in the mutated city (Steppes) and the Hurghada dragon hatchling caves.<br><br>

37) Cledwyn's item offers have been reworked. All items are now cheaper, grant more skills, but also reduce your resistances.<br><br>

38) Lots of unused and rare items were reworked by granting them additional positive and/or negative attributes.<br><br>

39) The break chance of some thrown weapons, such as the Assassin Star, has been reduced.<br><br>

40) Distance shop NPCs will now exchange your soul orbs for more Infernal Bolts.<br><br>

41) Monster raids occur throughout the day. More powerful monster raids will be announced with a global message.<br><br>

42) The Tasks NPC (The Great Tracker) now offers a set of imbuement items in exchange for gold and task points (earned by completing tasks). You can talk to him in every major city.<br><br>

43) Every few hours, a coin lottery takes place, awarding a small amount of coins to one random player.<br><br>

44) Minigame hub teleport was added to most cities. Minigames are run either automatically or manually by a gm. Currently we have 4 minigames: VisLuxVersus (original), Meteor, Bomberman, Zombie.
